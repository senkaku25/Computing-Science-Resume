# resume-spring-2017


  When creating this resume I knew that I didn't hold a great amount of experience in a 'real job' yet; being that I am only fresh into the first year of university. Nevertheless, as you've probably heard from a best selling biography book or guest speaker who visits the office, even the best must start somewhere. And so, I tried to focus on my strenghs as a young and excited student. For what I lack in hours in the office, I make up for in my hunger for new challenges and my quest for new tricks. When things are too comfortable I seek more problems to solve and more skills to conquer. I am new to the world of meetings, calls, and project reports; but do not look past my experience in technical skills. My initial naivety makes me more motivated and continuously inspired to not just go home when the work day is done, but to stay until I can say that I am proud of how I optimized what I had worked on. My ability to grow into a professional in any field shows that I am not bound by anything.
  
  Thanks for reading my resume :) !
