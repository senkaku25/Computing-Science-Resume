# resume-spring-2017


  When creating this resume I knew that I didn't hold a great amount of experience in a 'real job' yet; being that I am only fresh into the first year of university. Nevertheless, as you've probably heard from a best seller biography or guest speaker who visits the office, even the best must start somewhere. And so, I tried to focus on what strenghs an employer could benefit from by hiring someone who is young, curious, and energetic. For instance, what I lack in hours in the office, I make up for in my hunger for new challenges and my pursuit for new tricks. When things are too comfortable I seek more problems to solve and more skills to conquer. Yes, I am new to the world of meetings, calls, and project reports; but do not look past my experience in technical skills. My initial naivety makes me more motivated and continuously inspired to not just go home when the work day is done, but to stay until I can say that I am proud of how I optimized my work to the quality that would exceed my employers beginner expections. My ability to grow into a professional in any field shows that I am not bound by anything and that I can be easily moulded to be optimal in any environment.
  
  Thanks for reading my resume :) !
